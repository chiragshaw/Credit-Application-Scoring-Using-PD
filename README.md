Credit Application Scoring Using Probability of Default (PD)
This project focuses on developing a Probability of Default (PD) model to assist banks and financial institutions in assessing the creditworthiness of loan applicants. The model predicts the likelihood of default for each applicant, helping lenders make data-driven decisions, minimize credit losses, and optimize loan portfolios.

Objective
To build a machine learning model that scores loan applicants based on their predicted probability of default, enabling banks to identify high-risk applicants before loan approval.

Approach
Data Understanding and Preparation: Explored the KGB dataset, a collection of loan information, to understand features and data structure. Processed and cleaned data, handling any missing values or outliers.
Feature Engineering: Created relevant features related to credit risk, such as debt-to-income ratios and payment history, to improve the model's predictive power.
Model Development: Developed a Probability of Default model using machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees to classify applicants as high or low risk.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC, ensuring reliable predictions for applicant risk assessment.
Outcome
The PD model enables banks to:

Identify high-risk applicants, reducing potential credit losses.
Improve loan portfolio quality through a standardized risk assessment.
Enhance decision-making with a data-driven approach to credit scoring.
